% Compute the pupil fuction given the wvf object.
%
%    wvf = wvfComputePupilFunction(wvf)
%
% The pupil function is a complex number that represents the amplitude and
% phase of the wavefront across the pupil.  The pupil function at a
% specific wavelength is
%
%    pupilF = A exp(-1i 2 pi (phase/wavelength));
%
% The amplitude, A, is set to 1 here.  The name for the amplitude is XXX (I
% forget) and we should be able to adjust it in the future.  
%
% The pupil function is related to the PSF by the Fourier transform. See J.
% Goodman, Intro to Fourier Optics, 3rd ed, p. 131. (MDL)  This is computed
% in the wvf2PSF function, not here.
%
% The pupil function is calculated for 10 orders of Zernike coefficients
% specified to the OSA standard, with the convention that we assume that
% the coefficient for j = 0 is 0, and that the first entry of the passed
% coefficients corresponds to j = 1.  Adding in the j = 0 term does not
% change the psf.  The spatial coordinate system is also OSA standard.
%
% Note that this system is the same for both left and right eyes. If the
% biology is left-right reflection symmetric, one might want to left-right
% flip the coordinates when computing for the left eye (see OSA document).

% 8/20/11 dhb      Rename function and pull out of supplied routine.
%                  Reformat comments.
% 9/5/11  dhb      Rewrite for wvf struct i/o.  Rename.
% 5/29/12 dhb      Removed comments about old inputs, since this now gets
%                  its data via wvfGet.
% 6/4/12  dhb      Implement caching system.
% 7/23/12 dhb      Add in tip and tilt terms to be consistent with OSA standard.
%                  Verified that these just offset the position of the psf by
%                  a wavelength independent amount for the current calculation.
% 7/24/12 dhb      Switch sign of y coord to match OSA standard.
