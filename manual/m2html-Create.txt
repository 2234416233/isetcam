1.  Make sure that m2html is on your path. A version is kept in pdcSoft, so the command

     pdcSoftPath

will put it on Brian's path.

2.  Create an exported version of iset-4.0, without the .svn files and other unversioned files.

3.  Change to the directory just above the exported version

4.  Run the commands

  mkdir('iset-manual')
  m2html('mfiles','iset-4.0', 'htmldir','iset-manual','source','off', 'recursive','on');
