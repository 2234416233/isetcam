function [outSensor, unitSigCurrent] = sensorCompute(sensor,oi,showBar)
%Compute sensor response from optical image data
%
%   sensor = sensorCompute([sensor],[oi],[showBar = 1])
%
%  This function calculates the sensor volts (electrons) at each pixel from
%  the optical image (oi).
%
% Inputs
%    sensor:   Image sensor, possibly a cell array of sensors
%    oi:       Optical irradiance data
%
% Return
%    sensor: Image sensor (possibly an array of sensors). The computed
%            voltage data are stored in the sensor.
%
%  The computation checks a variety of parameters and flags in the sensor
%  structure to perform the calculation.  These parameters and flags can be
%  set either through the graphical user interface (sensorWindow) or
%  by scripts.
%
% NOISE FLAG
%  The noise flag is an important way to control the details of the
%  calculation.  The default value of the noiseFlag is 2.  In this case,
%  which is standard operating, photon noise, read/reset, FPN, analog
%  gain/offset, clipping, quantization, are all included.  Different
%  selections are made by different values of the noiseFlag.  
%
%   sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'noise flag',noiseFlag);   
%
% The conditions are:
%
%  noiseFlag | photon other-noises gain/offset clipping quantize cds
%    -2      |   +         0            0         0        0      + 
%    -1      |   0         0            0         0        0      +
%     0      |   0         0            +         +        +      +
%     1      |   +         0            +         +        +      +
%     2      |   +         +            +         +        +      +
%     3      |   +         0            0         0        0      +
%
%  Several of the factors are effectively removed by setting the
%  sensor parameters.  Specifically,
%
%   * analog-gain/offset - set the parameters to 1,0 (default)
%   * quantization       - set 'quantization method' to 'analog' (default)
%   * CDS                - set the cds flag to false (default)
%   * Clipping           - You can avoid clipping high with a large
%        voltage swing.  But other noise factors might drive the
%        voltage below 0, and we would clip. 
%        If you just want photon noise, us noiseFlag = -2

% COMPUTATIONAL OUTLINE:
%
%   This is an overview of the algorithms.  The specific algorithms are
%   described in the routines themselves.
%
%   1. Check exposure duration: autoExposure default, or use the set
%      time.
%   2. Compute the mean image: sensorComputeImage()
%   3. Etendue calculation to account for pixel vignetting 
%   4. Noise, analog gain, clipping, quantization
%   5. Correlated double-sampling
%   6. Macbeth ROI management
%
%  The value of showBar determines whether the waitbar is displayed to
%  indicate progress during the computation.
